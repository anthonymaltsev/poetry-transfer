# Textual Style Transfer Using Iterative Back Translation

Authors: Anthony Maltsev, Michael Young-jin Cho

This is a project for CS230 at Stanford University in which we investigated different systems for textual style transfer between two non-parallel mono style corpora. We implement a form of Iterative Back Translation attempting to do authorship transfer between Shakespeare and New York School poets.
